The game siam recreated in Kotlin

Elephants start the game. 
You can move, push and remove an animal. After moving you can decide which way to face. 
Animals always push wherever they face.
Every animal has a strength of one meaning they can push 1 rock, if there is another animal facing the opposite direction he also weighs one. Therefor you cannot push a rock that has another animal behind it facinbg the opposite direction.
The goal of the game is to push one rock off. 
You can only remove animals that are on the battlefield. 
Animals knocked off go back to the player's hand. 

The Game does not end when the rock is pushed off, however console logs the winner.
